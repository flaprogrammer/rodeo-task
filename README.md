### Commands

- `npm start`
- `npm test`

## Description

Here are my notes to this small project

- Used `React` and `TypeScript`
- `react-router-dom` for routing
- Built no architecture, since the project is very small. But put pages into `pages`, reusable components into `shared`, project related components into `components` folders
- `react-query` helped me with async requests and caching
- `dayjs` for counting days until Invoice expires
- `mui` for material design
- Added unit tests for utils folder, for pure functions
- `useMemo` hook helped me to prevent recalculations 
- Emulated loading from server using setTimeout, stored data in `mockdata.json`
- Kept TS types in `types` folder
